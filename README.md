# Influence-Network-in-Twitter
# Problem statement

How to use tweet, retweet and user data to identify and characterize the user is influencer or not?

# Dataset Statistics:
The directional graph is developed between twitter user on specific topic.

# Sentiment Folder 

It conatains the code to analyze the sentiment of the tweets. The Textblob library is used to provide sentiment to each tweet as -1, 0, 1.

# BaseLine Implementation

The baseline model are implemented for measuring the influence of the user in the Twitter network.

# Model

Three models were implemetated

# 1. GCN with Influence network:

In this model Graph Convolutional Network is used to classify the nodes of the Twitter network as influencer and non-influencer.

# 2. Link Partition:

In this model the link partition method is used with Retweet information information of each user for each tweet.

# 3. Node Classification:

Tn this approach the Features are generated from Twitter API data and classify each node as Influencer and non-influencer using these three models.
